# Vintage Story - Omok
Adding functionality to Omok blocks

Just put the zip in the releases tab into your Vintage Story mods folder

Adds functionality to chair and Omok blocks. Right click on chairs to sit on them. If they're adjacent to a table, your character's orientation will be locked to the table.

Right click on Omok boards to place pieces. First player to get five in a row wins. You can set a single player or two player game by using tool select mode (Default: 'F')

0.4.0 is the most recent stable release. No known bugs. There are plans to add Go in the future.

Enjoy!
