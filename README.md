# Vintage Story - Omok
Adding functionality to Omok blocks

WORK IN PROGRESS
Just put the zip in the releases folder into your Vintage Story mods folder

Right now the only Omok block with functionality is in a new block, the only way to get it is through creative mode. Just search for 'omok', it's the block with a top-down texture.

Sneak click to place it, then right click the empty spots on the board to place pieces.

This is an alpha version, I'll continue to update it throughout the week. May not work in multiplayer servers yet.
